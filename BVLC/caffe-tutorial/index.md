# DIY Deep Learning for Vision: <br> a Hands-On Tutorial with Caffe

This is a hands-on tutorial intended to present state-of-the-art deep learning models and equip vision researchers with the tools and know-how to incorporate deep learning into their work.
Deep learning models and deep features have recently achieved strong results in classification and recognition, detection, and segmentation, but a common framework and shared models are needed to advance further work and reduce the barrier to entry.

To this end we present the [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) – Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding – framework that offers an open-source library, public reference models, and worked examples for deep learning in vision.
Demos will be done live and the audience will be able to follow along with examples.
To do so, follow the [tutorial installation instructions](/installation.html).

**Check out the [tutorial guide](/tutorial) on the [tutorial edition of the Caffe site](/tutorial_index.html)** for documentation, examples, and more.

**Slides**

- [Caffe Tutorial, pt. 1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UeKXVgRvvxg9OUdh_UiC5G71UMscNPlvArsWER41PsU/edit#slide=id.p): the Caffe tour
- [Caffe Tutorial, pt. 2](/eccv14-diy-pt2.pdf): deep learning for detection, fine-tuning, training analysis

## Schedule

This half-day morning tutorial is held Sunday, September 7 at 9:00 — 12:30.
Part one 9:00 - 10:30 will give a tour of Caffe and examples.
Part two 11:00 - 12:30 will continue the tour and cover fine-tuning, model interpretation and analysis, and R-CNN.
There will a break for open discussion and coffee at 10:30 – 11:00.

**Caffe Tour** 9 - 10:30

- Introduction: deep learning and the need for frameworks
- Philosophy: expressive, fast, modular, and open
- Model Anatomy: nets, layers, blobs
- Forward / Backward computation
- Data
- Loss
- Solver / model optimization
- Interfaces for command line, Python, and MATLAB

**Caffeine** 10:30 - 11:00

- coffee!
- examples / demos
- discussion

**Fine-tuning, Model Analysis, and More** 10:00 - 12:30

- Fine-tuning
- Model interpretation and analysis
- R-CNN
- tips and tricks

## Audience

**Beginners**: you will be equipped with the tools and know-how to begin or improve your deep learning toolkit through talks, worked examples, and demos.

**Intermediate**: follow along for a walkthrough of model definition and development, framework extension, and tips and tricks in practice will be covered.

**Advanced**: join for discussion of advanced modeling and optimization as well as news of the latest developments brewing in Caffe.

## Materials

Everything will be bundled in the next Caffe release, and is published now on this site and in the dev branch of BVLC/caffe.
