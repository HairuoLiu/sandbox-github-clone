Alternatives
------------

There are some good alternatives to PyKeyboard out there.

[autopy](https://github.com/msanders/autopy) is written as a C extension to
Python and works very well on Windows, Mac, and X11 (Linux). It provides
mouse control, keyboard control, [and more.](http://www.autopy.org/documentation/api-reference/)

[Xpresser](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xpresser) is a good Linux-only alternative
that operates with X11. It provides tools for GUI-automation and also
implements opencv for image matching.

[sikuli](http://www.sikuli.org/) deserves mention as a notable cross-platform
GUI-automation tool that provides user emulation and image matching ability.
