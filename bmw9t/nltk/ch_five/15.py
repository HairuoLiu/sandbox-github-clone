# â—‘ Write programs to process the Brown Corpus and find answers to the following questions:
# Which tags are nouns most commonly found after? What do these tags represent? - articles or adjectives are the most common. complete
# Which nouns are more common in their plural form, rather than their singular form? (Only consider regular plurals, formed with the -s suffix.) complete
# Which word has the greatest number of distinct tags. What are they, and what do they represent? complete
# List tags in order of decreasing frequency. What do the 20 most frequent tags represent? - complete
