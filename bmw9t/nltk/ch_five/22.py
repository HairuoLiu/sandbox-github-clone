# â—‘ We defined the regexp_tagger that can be used as a fall-back tagger for unknown words. This tagger only checks for cardinal numbers. By testing for particular prefix or suffix strings, it should be possible to guess other tags. For example, we could tag any word that ends with -s as a plural noun. Define a regular expression tagger (using RegexpTagger()) that tests for at least five other patterns in the spelling of words. (Use inline documentation to explain the rules.)

patterns = [
	(r'.*ed$', 'VBD'), # simple past'
	(r'.*ing$', 'VBG'), # gerunds end in 'ing'
	(r'.*s$', 'NNS'), # plural noun
	(r'.*\'s', 'NN$'), # possessive
	(r'.*', 'NN') # 
]
