# â˜… Consider the code in 5 which determines the upper bound for accuracy of a trigram tagger. Review Abney's discussion concerning the impossibility of exact tagging (Church, Young, & Bloothooft, 1996). Explain why correct tagging of these examples requires access to other kinds of information than just words and tags. How might you estimate the scale of this problem?

Correct tagging requires you to basically have the entire context of the english language, right? So you need much more information than a computer can ever have. The scale of this problem is such that as you approach an infinite training size you approach maximum accuracy.
