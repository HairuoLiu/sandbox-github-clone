# â˜¼ We can use the slice notation to remove 
# morphological endings on words. For example,
#  'dogs'[:-1] removes the last character of dogs, 
#  leaving dog. Use slice notation to remove the affixes
#   from these words (we've inserted a hyphen to indicate
#    the affix boundary, but omit this from your strings)
#   : dish-es, run-ning, nation-ality, un-do, pre-heat.
