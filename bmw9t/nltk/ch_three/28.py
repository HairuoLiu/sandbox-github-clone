# â—‘ Consider the numeric expressions in the following sentence from the MedLine Corpus: The corresponding free cortisol fractions in these sera were 4.53 +/- 0.15% and 8.16 +/- 0.23%, respectively. Should we say that the numeric expression 4.53 +/- 0.15% is three words? Or should we say that it's a single compound word? Or should we say that it is actually nine words, since it's read "four point five three, plus or minus zero point fifteen percent"? Or should we say that it's not a "real" word at all, since it wouldn't appear in any dictionary? Discuss these different possibilities. Can you think of application domains that motivate at least two of these answers?

# Should we say that the numeric expression 4.53 +/- 0.15% is three words? i imagine I would say this if i was interested computationally in being able to pull out what that might mean numerically. so that i could use it later for a computer

# Or should we say that it's a single compound word? i'd lean towards this if i'm interested in linguistics

# Or should we say that it is actually nine words, since it's read "four point five three, plus or minus zero point fifteen percent"? no way

# Or should we say that it's not a "real" word at all, since it wouldn't appear in any dictionary? even if it's not a real word, it would have applications for the computer. if i was interested in the semantic content of the words, I might look up to see if there is a particular word for that operator.
