# â˜… With the help of a multilingual corpus such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Corpus (nltk.corpus.udhr), and NLTK's frequency distribution and rank correlation functionality (nltk.FreqDist, nltk.spearman_correlation), develop a system that guesses the language of a previously unseen text. For simplicity, work with a single character encoding and just a few languages.
