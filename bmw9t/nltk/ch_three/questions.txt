43 - You have it spitting out spearman correlations for a single text. It does that by converting each text to a clump of letters, normalizing and eliminating punctuation, and then comparing the rankings of letters between texts. It is not really accurate. Is comparing by the statistical frequency of particular characters not the best way to do it? English does come out pretty high, but not all the way up there It sometimes does give English as the correct text, but def not all the time. Curiouser though - the spearman correlations change each time that the program runs. What's up with that? Could that be part of the problem? Or is there some statistical voodoo going on that I'm not aware of? It does work a bit better if you restrict the number of languages. So, for example, it is probably about 90% accurate if you limit it to Spanish, French, German, and English.
