https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Oracle%20Instant%20Client


Download the Oracle Instantclient RPM files from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-097480.html. Everyone needs either "Basic" or "Basic lite", and most users will want "SQL*Plus" and the "SDK".

Convert these .rpm files into .deb packages and install using "alien" ("sudo apt-get install alien" if you don't have it):

alien -i oracle-instantclient-basic*.rpm
alien -i oracle-instantclient-sqlplus*.rpm
alien -i oracle-instantclient-devel*.rpm
Test your Instantclient install by using "sqlplus" to connect to your database:

sqlplus  username/password@//dbhost:1521/SID
If sqlplus complains of a missing libaio.so.1 file, run 

sudo apt-get install libaio1
If sqlplus complains of a missing libsqlplus.so file, follow the steps in the section "Integrate Oracle Libraries" below.

If you execute sqlplus and get "sqlplus: command not found", see the section below about adding the ORACLE_HOME variable. 

Integrate Oracle Libraries
If oracle applications, such as sqlplus, are complaining about missing libraries, you can add the Oracle libraries to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH each time it is used, or to add it to the system library list create a new file as follows:

sudo vi /etc/ld.so.conf.d/oracle.conf
and add the oracle library path as the first line. For example,

/usr/lib/oracle/11.1.0.1/client/lib
or

/usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client/lib/
Then run ldconfig:
sudo ldconfig

export TNS_ADMIN=/usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client/lib
