# django-pandas-examples

Some iPython/Jupyter Notebooks that Illustrate the use of [django-pandas](https://github.com/chrisdev/django-pandas). Django pandas provides tools for working with pandas in your Django projects.

## Getting Started

* Clone the repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/chrisdev/django-pandas-examples.git
```

* Install the necessary requirements globally or inside a [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/):

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This can be difficult to get set up and require you to compile a whole bunch of things. You can use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda), which is a Python distribution which will give you everything you need.

* Start the Jupyter notebook

```
$ cd django-pandas-examples/notebooks
$ jupyter notebook
```

A tab should open up in your browser at `http://localhost:8888`

Play with these notebooks and Happy learning!
