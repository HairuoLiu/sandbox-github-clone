Two weeks ago, I had got myself known to the Maximum Entropy Model,
but when you want to verify that maxent model will work like the
way u think, it will be difficult. and here is how i try to solve
this verifying problem one by one.

1, The implementation of the maxent algorithm
turns out that are bunch of implementations of maxent in several
languages. here I will use the Python and C++ implementation by
a researcher called ZhangLe.

2, The data you use to classify
After Googling around, I decided to use the CSDMC2010 SPAM corpus
as my dataset, it contains a lot of emails classfied by the
researcher manually.

3, Retrieve the subject and content from the original email file
Since the original email file contains email tags, I need to remove
these tags.

4, Represent the processed file from formal step as a vector.
for the features you choose, for each email file, you will get an
vector indicating wheather it is apeared.

5, use maxent trainning the model.

6, use the test dataset test the model.
