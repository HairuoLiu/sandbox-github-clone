Scikit-learn's HMM support is currently deprecated, and so comparing a list of features may not be appropriate. However, it uses matrix operations which have been optimized in C to perform the underlying math, and so comparing the speed of supported features is a good test to see if YAHMM is in the same general range for speed."
